                        <strong>1.</strong> Find a comedic angle to everything. The benefit of being nonchalant isn't about not being happy – it's about not easily getting upset, angry, or stressed. And how might one do that? Well, when everything is comical is a good start. Just like most things have a silver lining, most things have a comedic edge to them, too.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="article-list">
                        <li>Though it's a simple example, let's say you trip onstage at some award ceremony. Instead of turning bright red in shame, you either brush it off like you meant it to happen and accept your award from the floor, or you put your arms in a "tada" moment and embrace the spotlight. Let the hooting and hollering commence.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="article-paragraph">
                        <strong>2.</strong> Pretend you don't have the "shame gene." All of us have that little voice in our head that's telling us to look cool and to act socially acceptable. This is generally a smart voice in our heads – it makes us friends, gets us connections, and makes life a little easier. But! Sometimes it's in our tracks, keeps us from growing, and just makes us worried, emotionally erratic, and anxious. Instead, pretend for a second that you have no shame. How do you act? What is your body telling the world? That's nonchalance.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="article-list">
                        <li>So much so that you're not even sure and it's not even worthy of your attention. If that urge wasn't within you, what might you do differently? Would you really care if Joel liked your shoes or if Marcia texted you back? Probably not. Start out by focusing on this just for a few minutes a day until it becomes naturally nearly all the time.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="article-paragraph">
                        <strong>3.</strong> Worry less about what you can't change. The world is going to end at some point. Do you worry about that? Probably not. Your mom sometimes wears the ugliest sweaters. Do you worry about that? Nope. If you can't change it, there's no point in worrying about. What can you do? Worry about you...and then even some more? There's no point.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="article-list">
                        <li>So when your teacher announces a pop quiz? No reaction from you. There's no point in worrying about it – the only thing you can worry about is doing well. And when your crush doesn't like you back? Welp. At least you were just feeling it out anyway.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="article-paragraph">
                        <strong>4.</strong> Don't take yourself (or anything) too seriously. All of life becomes infinitely easier when you stop taking everything so seriously. The world is not out to get you (even if it feels that way sometimes). People are not judging you as harshly as you think. And that embarrassing moment? Everyone will forget about it by tomorrow.
